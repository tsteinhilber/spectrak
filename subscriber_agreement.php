  	<h1>SPECTRAK.DAYMON.COM SUBSCRIBER AGREEMENT AND TERMS OF USE </h1>
    <p>UPDATED ON November 17, 2010<br />
      <br>
      PLEASE SCROLL DOWN AND READ THE SUBSCRIBER AGREEMENT AND TERMS OF USE BELOW.<br>
      This Subscriber Agreement and Terms of Use govern your use of Spectrak.Daymon.com (The &ldquo;Site&rdquo;), and unless other terms and conditions expressly govern, any other electronic services from Galileo Global Branding Group Inc. (&ldquo;Daymon&rdquo;) that may be made available from time to time (each, a &quot;Service&quot;). <br>
    If you agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, you should click on the &quot;I AGREE&quot; button at the end of this Agreement. If you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, you should click &quot;I DISAGREE.&quot; If you click &quot;I DISAGREE,&quot; you will not be able to proceed with the registration process for the respective Service and become a subscriber. To the extent you have access to, or are using, a Service without having completed Daymon&rsquo;s registration process or clicked on an &quot;I AGREE&quot; button, you are hereby notified that your continued use of a Service is subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Changes to Subscriber Agreement.</strong> Daymon may change the terms of this Agreement at any time by notifying you of the change in writing or electronically (including without limitation, by email or by posting a notice on the Service that the terms have been &quot;updated&quot;). The changes also will appear in this document, which you can access at any time by going to the Terms and Conditions link of a Service. You signify that you agree to be bound by such changes by using a Service after changes are made to this Agreement.</li>
      <li><strong>Privacy and Your Account.</strong> Registration data and other information about you are subject to the Privacy Policy which you may access by going to the Privacy Policy link of the Site. Your information may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country where Daymon has facilities, and by subscribing to a Service, you consent to the transfer of information outside of your country. If your access to a Service has been provided by or through a third party (for example, your employer) (each, a &quot;Third Party&quot;), the Third Party may have provided Daymon with information about you to enable Daymon to provide you with access to the Service and distinguish you from other subscribers (such as your email address or name). If you access a Service using a password, you are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of that password. If you provide someone else with access to your password to a Service, they will have the ability to view information about your account and make changes through the website for the Service. You agree to notify Daymon promptly if you change your address or email so we can continue to contact you and send any notices required hereunder. If you fail to notify Daymon promptly of a change, then any notice Daymon sends to your old address or email shall be deemed sufficient notice.</li>
      <li><strong>Limitations on Use. </strong> 
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Only one individual may access a Service at the same time using the same user name or password, unless we agree otherwise.

Daymon reserves the right to terminate or restrict your access to a Service if, in Daymon&rsquo;s opinion, your use of the Service may violate any laws, regulations or rulings, infringe upon another person's rights or violate the terms of this Agreement. Also, Daymon may refuse to grant you a user name that impersonates someone else, is protected by trademark or other proprietary right law, or is vulgar or otherwise offensive.</li>
          <li>You agree not to take any action that disrupts the normal functioning of <a href="https://spectrak.daymon.com">spectrak.daymon.com</a> or imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on Daymon&rsquo;s infrastructure.&nbsp; You shall not use, transmit, or cause to be transmitted, any device, software, computer programming routine, information, data, virus, time bomb, &ldquo;Trojan horse,&rdquo; &ldquo;easter egg&rdquo;, worm, cancelbot or other matter that may damage, interfere with, intercept, impair or expropriate any Daymon.com systems, software, data or functionality, or those of any user of Daymon&rsquo;s Services.&nbsp; You shall not use any robot, spider, other automatic device or manual process to monitor or copy Daymon&rsquo;s web pages or the content contained therein without Daymon&rsquo;s prior express written permission.&nbsp; You shall not harvest or attempt to harvest or otherwise collect information about other users (including e-mail addresses) for any purpose other than authorized use of specktrak.daymon.com without the consent of such users and the express written consent of Daymon. </li>
